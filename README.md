### Overview

- Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years building NLP, speech, and LLM systems; expert in embeddings, hybrid inference (Rust/Python), and evaluation pipelines.
- Passionate about end-to-end AI platforms: platform architecture, prompt orchestration, distillation/QA workflows, dataset/version control, and lightweight desktop tooling.
- Personal projects cover: a full-stack Nexus AI Engine (FastAPI + Next.js + Prefect), a local-first semantic file intelligence tool (Rust + ONNX + Tauri), and ML-powered hiring/document automation services.
- Always exploring new tooling, evaluation frameworks, and pipeline automation to keep research code production-ready.
